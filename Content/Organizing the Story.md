# Organizing the Story

Let’s take our project—a service, event, product, charity, etc—and approach it as if it has a life of its own. Somehow, either directly or indirectly, it is meant to affect people and/or their environments. That’s what gives it value, and that’s why audiences will interact with it.

## MESSAGE

Taking that value, we are going to use the story we are telling as a way to communicate the effects of our project on its demographic in order to share our message. Our message will be the call-to-action to the audience once they are engaged with our story: buy a product, subscribe to a service, join a club, make a donation, etc.

#### <em>My story's message is: _________</em>


## THE FOUR MAIN COMPONENTS
PELEIO Storytelling boils down a story into four main components, in a sequence like this: in an ENVIRONMENT, a CHARACTER is disrupted by a FORCE that leads to a RESULT.

As an example, let’s imagine a house with broken plumbing. The wet, leaky house is our ENVIRONMENT causing distress in our CHARACTER. The plumber finally arrives with his services as the FORCE that saves the day. Our RESULT is fixed pipes and relief:

The CHARACTER will represent the demographic affected by our FORCE—remember, that’s our project we’re selling—which means we want to relate to our audience here with a similar culture, language, habitat, et cetera. This demographic is paired with its ENVIRONMENT, the CHARACTER’s current world or reality before the FORCE enters the picture.

In traditional narrative, our disrupting FORCE would have us thinking of a conflict, our human challenge that demonstrates vulnerability in the character. But in PELEIO Storytelling, our FORCE is a solution to the conflict which engages the audience to receive our message.

Our FORCE will offer a solution to our CHARACTER’s problem, meaning that the tension our audience experiences will be conveyed through a vulnerability wrought of our CHARACTER’s relationship with their ENVIRONMENT.


#### <em>WHO IS MY CHARACTER? (DEMOGRAPHIC/AUDIENCE)</em>





#### <em>WHAT IS THEIR CURRENT ENVIRONMENT LIKE? (CONTEXT/ESTABLISHMENT)</em>





#### <em>WHAT IS THE FORCE THAT COMES ALONG TO AFFECT THEM? (THE PRODUCT/SERVICE/EVENT/ACTIVITY/ETC)</em>





#### <em>WHAT IS THE RESULT OF CHARACTER/ENVIRONMENT MEETING FORCE?</em>
(WHY SHOULD YOUR MESSAGE BE CONSIDERED?)
