# PELEIO Video Storytelling Guide
This project is part of a bigger effort to to make the video storytelling production process more accessible to the average human being. By encouraging non-formal education, empowering in-house video production, and incentivizing p2p networking we hope to eventually connect enough people that we can receive our information of the world without third-party interference. 

This particular guide seeks to introduce how storytelling works and how we can use it to produce media indepdently and affordably.
